Currently, I'm working on "DiseaseDetector.py," a project that analyzes a disease dataset. At the same time, I'm picking new information about machine learning to improve my projects. My area of expertise lies in Python, NumPy, and Pandas, but I also have experience in Java. On this page, you'll find my GitHub stats and trophies.
